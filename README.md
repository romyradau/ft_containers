# ft_containers
In this project I implemented a few container types of the C++ standard template library.
Simply clone the repo and type make, followed by make diff.
Check the Makefile for the diff instructions.
I attached a main with several test, feel free to add your own. 
The main checks how long the std containers vs mine take and demonstrate the output.
